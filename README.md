ML-based ride demand forecasting
# 🚲 Ola Bike Ride Request Forecast using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Ride-hailing platforms like **Ola** face significant challenges in matching bike availability with user demand. Accurate demand forecasting helps reduce waiting time, optimize fleet allocation, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project focuses on **forecasting Ola bike ride requests** using **Machine Learning techniques** based on historical ride data, temporal features, and demand patterns.
